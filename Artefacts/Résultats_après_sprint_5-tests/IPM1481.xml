Nowadays, job seekers can send their curriculum vitae (CV) directly to companies (by e-mailor uploaded to dedicated servers on the Web). The job search task is becoming easier and less time consuming. The Internetmakes every user a potential job seeker. Employees may be constantly in search of new career opportunities and job candidates may provide more interaction than can be managed efﬁciently by companies ( Bourse, LeclFre, Morin, & Trichet, 2004 ).As intellectual capital has become one of the most strategic assets of successful organizations in the last decade, the capability of managing people’s expertise, skills and experience represents a key factor in facing up to the increasing competitiveness of the global market ( Colucci et al., 2003 ).

In this context, electronic recruitment tends to automate matching between the published information about the candidates and job offers. The Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon (LIA),2theLaboratoire d’Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier (LIRMM),3and Aktor Interactive4are developingthe E-Gen system to resolve this issue.
