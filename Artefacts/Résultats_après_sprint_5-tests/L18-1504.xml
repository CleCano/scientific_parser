	<abstract>  Multi-sentence compression aims to generate a short and informative compression from several source sentences that deal with the same topic. In this work, we present a new corpus for the Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC) task in Portuguese and Spanish. We also provide on this corpus a comparison of two state-of-the-art MSC systems. Keywords: Annotated Corpus, Multi-Sentence Compression, Multilingual Corpus. </abstract>
	<introduction> Among the various applications of Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) aims atsummarizing one or more texts automatically. Summarization systems identify relevant data and create a summaryfrom key information. The (Multi-)Sentence Compressiontask can be seen as a subproblem of ATS with the objectiveto generate a shorter, informative and correct sentence fromsource sentence(s).In many cases, state-of-the-art NLP systems are evaluatedwith experiments restrained to the English language, in partbecause there are a lot of available English resources formost NLP tasks. As regards Multi-Sentence Compression(MSC), the available resources are unfortunately limited; toour knowledge, only one dataset is freely available and it isconÔ¨Åned to the French language (Boudin and Morin, 2013).In this work, we present a new annotated corpus in the Portuguese and Spanish languages for the MSC task. Usingthis corpus, we evaluate two state-of-the-art systems andshow that the use of several languages leads to more mitigated results on the superiority of one system than the useof the French corpus alone.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we characterize MSC with respect to related tasksfrom the perspective of the available corpora. Section 3describes the creation and the features of our corpus. InSection 4 we analyze the results achieved by state-of-theart methods using our dataset. Finally, conclusions are setout in Section 5. </introduction>
