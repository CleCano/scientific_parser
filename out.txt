Résumé de l'article :
 We introduce BLESS, a data set speciﬁcally designed for the evaluation of distributional semantic models. BLESS contains a set of tuples instantiating different, explicitly typed semantic relations, plus a number of controlled random tuples. It is thus possible to assess the ability of a model to detect truly related word pairs, as well as to perform in-depth analyses of the types of semantic relations that a model favors. We discuss the motivations for BLESS, describe its construction and structure, and present examples of its usage in the evaluation of distributional semantic models.
