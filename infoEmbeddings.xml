	<introduction>The Social Web is a great source for studying human interaction and behavior. Inthe last few years, there is an exponential growth in Social Media user base. Sensingcontent of Social Media like Facebook, Twitter, by the smart autonomous applicationempower its user community with real-time information which is unfolded across thedierent part of the world. Social media provide the easiest and anonymous platformfor common people to voice their opinion or view on a various entity like celebrity,politician, product, stock market etc or any social movement. Sometime such opinionsmight be aggressive in nature and propagate hate in the social media community.With the unprecedented increase in the user base of the social media and its availability on the Smartphones, incidents like Hate speech, trolling, Cyberbullying, andAggressive posts are increasing exponentially. A smart autonomous system is requiredwhich enable surveillance on the social media platform and detect such incidents.Some of the researchers look posts from the aspect like aggression Kumar Ritesh etal. (2018) to lter the contents. some of the posts contain words which might be qualied as either highly or overly aggressive or have hidden aggression. Sometimes postsdo not have any aggression. Based on these, posts or comments are categorized intothree classes namely: `Overtly Aggressive`, `Covertly Aggressive√†nd `Non-aggressive`Kumar Ritesh et al. (2018). Henceforth, in the rest of the paper, we will denote theseclasses by these abbreviations namely: OAG, CAG, NAG respectively.Table 1 showsthe sample posts belonging to these classes.Social Media, specically Microblog has proved its importance during the disasterrelated incidents like an earthquake, Hurricane and oods1. Organizations involvedin relief operation actively track posts related to situational information posted onFacebook and Twitter during the disaster. However, At the same time, social mediais ooded with lots of prayer and condolence messages. Posts which contain factualinformation are extremely important for the organization involved in post-disasterrelief operations for coordination. Filtering and Ranking of the posts containing factualinformation will be very useful to them. We believe that this is the special problemof the Sentiment Analysis task. We consider this problem as a combination of twoclass classication problem: factual posts and nob-factual posts plus Ranking. Table</introduction>

	<conclusion>In this Paper, Multilingual Social media stream is studied with special kind of textfeatures: Aggression and fact perspective. Exhaustive experiments are performed tobenchmark the text representation scheme on machine learning classiers and deepneural nets. From the results, we conclude that deep Neural model with pre-trainedword embedding is the better choice than machine earning classier and transfer learning model. Word embedding is the better text representative scheme than Bag-of-wordsfor the deep neural models. In fact, performance can be improved with the help of fastText pre-trained vector. However, machine learning classiers perform better in BoWwith TF/IDF weighting than word embedding. We also concluded that higher dropout will help to counter model overtting and improvise a standard evaluation metrics.CNN and LSTM are the better models for these datasets. On the English test corpus,we obtained a better weighted F1score for NAG class and poor weighted F1scorefor CAG class which supports the previous (Malmasi, et al. , 2017) ndings. For theFacebook Hindi test corpus, the same seems not to be true. We obtained a better F1score for CAG class than NAG class. It is also to be noted that the model leads topoor result on Twitter test data since the training corpus was created from Facebook.In such cases, deep neural models substantially outperform machine learning classiers. Signicance test conrms these claims with 95 % condence interval in most thecases. Our work shows what kind of problems are moving into the center of attentionfor research in machine learning. Using deep learning models, there is great potentialto solve some of these problems, yet still, the performance is far from perfect. Modeltransfer between problems and the application of derived knowledge in user interfacesare areas directions for future work.</conclusion>
